# Big Nerd Ranch iOS Book Exercises

This repo contains my work as I read through "iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide" (6th Edition). Just to track progress. I plan on making a commit after finishing each chapter. 🤓📖

## The Swift Programming Language
I'm adding this section to track reading through the official "The Swift Programming Language" book. I completed "A Swift Tour" before starting BNR, and then BNR directed me to read some sections of the SPL, so I'd like to read the whole thing. I'll probably retain something useful.
